# While this game is open source and anyone can contribute, there are a few ground rules I must lay down:
* All submitted content **must** meet certain standards (art, text, etc.). I will **not** have half-assed graphics or text.
* By making any Contribution to the Project, potential contributers agree to give the project creator(s) and/or maintainers a perpetual, unlimited, royalty-free license to reuse, incorporate, distribute, modify, or extend the aforementioned Contribution in any fashion they see fit.

*This is to prevent the case of someone submitting code or content to the game, then coming back at a later date and demanding removal unless certain conditions are met. I need to retain control over all of the game's content, and, while I will always do my very best to respect your submitted content's themes and intentions, I need to be able to have the final say in the event of any conflicts.*

**Content that will never be accepted:**
* Lolicon/Shotacon
* Watersports
* Guro
* Vore
* Scat
* NTR/Cuckolding
* Furry (unless they're humans in a fursuit)
* Non-Consensual
* Incest
